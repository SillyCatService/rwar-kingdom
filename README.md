# Hello!
Theres are just a bunch of Roblox Lua Scripts Meant for the Roblox Executor ```Delta || (android Version)```.
it changes The Ui if you got bored of the default Delta Looks and want a New Executor but don't wanna reinstall Roblox
this is for you-
It got a Bunch of Popular Executors UI like
- **Codex (Android)**
- **Cubix**
- **Apple-Ware**
- **SteamPunk** (this one isnt popular i just found it cool)
- and More coming Soon!
# How to Use?
its simple,
- 1 downloaded the zip/file
- 2 after you got the zip extract it
- 3 you should have 2 folders, One Nammed **Executors** and the other **Configuration**
- 4 in the **Executor** folder **Copy** or **Move** the executor *.txt* file you would like, for example if you want codex, copy/move **Codex.txt**
- 5 after you copied your executor .txt move/past it in your Delta **Autoexecute** Folder,
- 6 after that go back to to the zipfile and this time go to the **Configuration** folder, in there theres a **.txt** called **switcher.txt**, Please also Place that in your **Autoexecute**
- 7 and thats it! enjoy!

# Notes üìù 
- if you want to replace executors make sure you delete the old **.txt** files in **Autoexecute** (you dont need to delete **Switcher.txt** btw)
- **NOTE** the **UNC** will be the same your not actually changing Delta your just changing the UI
- this also means no this isnt how you bypass the KeySystem üíÄ
